# UART_IoT_Project

This Project is mainly based on the UART communication protocol, which builds between ESP32 (Sender) and ARDUINO UNO (Reciever) and the sender only wake up from the "deepSleep mode" only when the triggers happen via pushbutton, else to optimise the power consumption, it remains stay in the "deepSleep mode".
